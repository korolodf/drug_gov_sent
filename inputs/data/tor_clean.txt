Toronto Public Health TPH  has submitted an application to the new provincial Consumption and Treatment Services program which replaces the former Supervised Injection Services program If approved the continuation of these services will ensure that people at risk of overdose are able to access this lifesaving service as they have since August    “The opioid overdose crisis is the defining health issue of our time Supervised consumption services save lives and are an important part of the response to this crisis” said Dr Eileen de Villa Toronto’s Medical Officer of Health “We are losing family members friends and colleagues and must do more to address this urgent public health issue”  Data from the Office of the Chief Coroner for Ontario OCCO confirm there were  opioid overdose deaths in Toronto in  While data are still coming in from the OCCO for  preliminary data indicate there were  opioid toxicity deaths in Toronto in the first six months This number is expected to rise as the cause of more deaths is confirmed These preliminary data show that a higher percentage of these deaths occurred among people who are experiencing homelessness compared to the rest of Ontario Further they show that half of all opioid deaths in Toronto occurred among people aged  to   In addition a oneyear review of paramedic data found that while the downtown area of the city had  per cent of the total calls for suspected overdose it had only  per cent of fatal calls This could be attributed to a higher density of harm reduction services in this area including supervised consumption services which reinforces the need for these health services in the city  “These health services provide a safer and hygienic environment for people who use drugs under the supervision of trained staff They also reduce the spread of HIV and Hepatitis C and public drug use” added Dr de Villa  To date there have been more than  visits to TPH’s supervised consumption service More than  overdoses were
