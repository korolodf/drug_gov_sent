						Toronto Public Health opened the city’s first permanent supervised consumption service on November 8, 2017. Located inside The Works at 277 Victoria Street, this life-saving health service provides a safe and hygienic environment for people to inject pre-obtained drugs under the supervision of qualified staff.
These important health services are part of the Toronto Overdose Action Plan, which was adopted by the Board of Health in March 2017, and updated in 2019. The Toronto Overdose Action Plan outlines a comprehensive approach to the overdose crisis in our city.
For statistics related to use of Toronto Public Health’s supervised consumption service, visit our statistics page.
						

  
      
        What is a Supervised Consumption Service?
      
      
        Supervised consumption services are health services that provide a hygienic environment for people to inject pre-obtained drugs under the supervision of trained staff. In addition to supervised injection, individuals are provided with sterile injection supplies, education on safer injection, overdose prevention and intervention, medical and counselling services, and referrals to drug treatment, housing, income support and other services.
International research shows that supervised consumption services reduce drug overdoses, save lives, and limit the spread of HIV and hepatitis C related to unsafe injection practices.

Supervised Consumption Services for Shelter Users (iPHARE)
Starting December 2020, the City will be committing $7.61 million to provide harm reduction and mental health services to shelter users in an effort to reduce the risk of opioid-related overdoses. Titled iPHARE (Integrated Prevention and Harm Reduction initiative) the program will include supervised consumption services in selected shelters, allowing shelter residents to consume drugs under trained supervision to reduce the risk of overdose.
The sites will not be open to the public. They are for residents of the shelter only. Learn more about iPHARE.

      
    
    
    
      
        How Do These Services Work?
      
      
        Clients arrive at the program with pre-obtained drugs. Clients are given sterile injecting equipment and instruction on safer injecting practices. Staff supervise injections in a room dedicated to this purpose, and intervenes in the case of any medical emergencies.
Once the individual has injected their drugs they go to a waiting room where they continue to be observed for any negative drug reactions. They also receive information and referrals about other health and social supports and services at the agency or elsewhere in the community.

      
    
    
    
      
        What Are the Benefits of These Services?
      
      
        International and Canadian research shows that supervised consumption services have benefits both for individuals using the services and for the community, including:
Reducing the number of drug overdoses and deaths
Reducing risk factors leading to infectious diseases such as HIV and hepatitis
Increasing the use of withdrawal management and drug treatment services
Connecting people with other health and social services
Reducing the amount of publicly discarded needles
Cost-effectiveness
Not contributing to crime or increased drug use in the local community
