international best practices for three to six consumption booths and potential operational models  Room Type  Description  Size For Six For Three Booths  Booths  Consumption booth Partitioned  sf per sf sf desktable with chair person  Assessment Room Accommodates sf sf sf interviewer workstationchair and clientchair two chairs if needed  Observation area  Workstations for sf sf sf supervisor staff workstation and chair  Post Space for at least six sf sf sf consumption aftercare client chairs and one three to area  small deskchair for four client supervisory staff chairs and a desk chair for supervisor    CHCs are typically Class D occupancy buildings under the Ontario Building Code and built to the OBC standard of the year of construction  The nature of the CTS selfadministered “treatment” will likely define this group as individuals potentially needing more time and assistance for evacuation in the event of fire due to potential degree of incapacitation Therefore this space will likely be considered a B occupancy under the Ontario Building Code and if so will require additional physical renovations to upgrade fire separations upgrades to the HVAC system fire alarm systems and doors to these areas The use of “cookers” may also prompt some other directions from the Ontario Fire Marshal’s office  As a best practice the injection area should include Counter space of ± linear feet per client The counter space should be nonporous hygienic and easily cleanable stainless steel is typical for most CTS sites Appropriate biohazard waste disposal should be available for each client Fixed mirrors should be provided for each client Appropriate lighting should be provided to promote safe injection practice Finish surfaces ie wall floor should be nonporous and easily cleanable A staff monitoring area should be provided in the postconsumption room with an emergency communication system Lockable supply cabinets should be provided in the room A hand hygiene sink and foot wash station should be provided in the CTS facility Security and access control should be considered as part of the model of care CSA ClassC ventilation should be provided in the space Consideration should be given to the unique ventilation needs dependent on the permitted uses of the site specifically enhanced ventilation should be considered if “cooking” is permitted Other spaces for clients to relax andor access care while observation continues and to provide wraparound services
