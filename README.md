# Starter folder

## Overview

This repo contains my work on applying topic modelling to Canadian government and municipality data on supervised consumption sites. 

## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `input/data` contains the data sources used in analysis including the raw data. Using NLP, these are txt files. Cleaned files are grouped together based on level of government (which is why there are fewer called clean!)
-   `outputs/paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper (called paper.pdf). In this folder, you will also find images of the graphs used to optimize my model. In the paper, this information is shown in table form for easier comparison of values, however they're a nice supplementary visual.
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download and clean data.
